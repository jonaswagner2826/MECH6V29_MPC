abstract = {This paper provides a novel solution to the problem of robust model predictive control of constrained, linear, discrete-time systems in the presence of bounded disturbances. The optimal control problem that is solved online includes, uniquely, the initial state of the model employed in the problem as a decision variable. The associated value function is zero in a disturbance invariant set that serves as the ‘origin’ when bounded disturbances are present, and permits a strong stability result, namely robust exponential stability of the disturbance invariant set for the controlled system with bounded disturbances, to be obtained. The resultant online algorithm is a quadratic program of similar complexity to that required in conventional model predictive control.}
